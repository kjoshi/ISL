# Notes about Chapter 3 - Linear Regression

## Prediction interval vs. confidence interval:
A prediction interval is similar in spirit to a confidence interval,
except that
the prediction interval is designed to cover a “moving target”,
the random future value of y, while
the confidence interval is designed to cover the “fixed target”,
the average (expected) value of y, E(y),
for a given x

Although both are centered at yˆ, the prediction interval is wider
than the confidence interval, for a given x and confidence level.
This makes sense, since
the prediction interval must take account of the tendency of y to
fluctuate from its mean value, while
the confidence interval simply needs to account for the
uncertainty in estimating the mean value.
